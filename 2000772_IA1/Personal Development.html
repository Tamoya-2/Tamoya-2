                           As I am often quiet, it gives me a better chance to listen to others whenever they talk to 
                           me. I am able to communicate with a number of individuals effectively. Over the years i have used various platforms to improve my method of communication.
                           Whether it be in an enclosed setting or not. I try to communicate with others of varying backgrounds to better understand them.
                           <br>
                          <strong>Kindness</strong><br>
                            I am a very kind individual, I tend to put others first in some instances. I am forgiving and tend to not hold grudges against anyone. I give a helping hand wherever and wheneverI can.

                           <br>

                           <strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong><br>
                                I have the ability to understand others. I have a firm grip on my emotional stability and can use this whenever i communicate with others. 
                                The past few years I have been using my commmunication skills to improve my emotional Intelligence.

                       <p>Goals, Time Management, Company,Continuous Education; all four of these pillars, if followed can lead
                            to a more comfortable, relaxed and meaningful life
                           My dream is to live such a life, I'm sure yours is too. After reading the book 'Twelve Pillars'
                            by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, I've re-established myself. 
                       <br>
                         <strong>Goals.</strong> Do you have any? If you don't, I advise you to think of one immediately. 
                         Thought about it? Now, <strong>write it down</strong>. Why? Writing down a goal brings your goal to life.
                          The mind is so powerful, it will start thinking up ideas on how to achieve this goal. Amazing right!, 
                          this is such an amazing fact to me.
                         I now have a method that can help me get to my goals and hold on to them. My reading brought me to the fact that, 
                         setting goals can make you a better person.
                         The lessons learned on my journey to achieving my goals, will help shape and mold my character. Each day I wake up, I will try to journal anything that comes to mind, 
                         any goal I wish to accomplish, whether it's long term or short term.<strong>I will write it down</strong>
                         <br>
                         <strong>Time Management</strong> What consumes most of your time? Are these activities apart of your steps to
                          acheiving your goal? I've learned to spend my time on what's important, what will eventually lead me to my goal. 
                         This, to me, means I'll get to my goal much faster.

                         <br>
                         <strong>Company and Continuous Education</strong>.<em>'Show me your friends and I'll tell you who you are.'</em> A decent and fair statement. 
                         One we hear quite often. The friends we have today, are they the same ones we had 5 years ago? If not, what caused the change?
                          Maybe they never lived up to your goals, or the influence they had on who you are and what you indulge in was not one you wanted
                         for yourself. 
                         <br>
                         'Formal education will make you a living, self-education will make you a fortune', beautifully said by the 
                         authors of Twelve Pillar. I wish to live a meaningful, stress-free life.
                         I want to enjoy the oneshot of life I've got; I want to break away from the zombie-like state
                         of working endlessly only to live paycheque after paycheque. In order to do this, I have to continuously grow and 
                         improve as a person. The first setp in doing so is by reading. I read a lot, but I want to read more, more books that i 
                         can apply to my life and become better.
